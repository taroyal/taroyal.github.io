My github  account will allow me to organize and control access to the code that I was given.
The repository was created by going to the upper right corner by going new repository, then I typed a short name that I could remember for my repository. 
Then I chosed a repository visualbility. Then I initialized the repository with a README. Finally, I clicked on "Create repository"
The steps I took to clone the repository onto my machine were:
1.I went to repository's main page
2. I clicked the Code above the file list
3. Then I copied the repository's URL
4. Then I typed git clone and pasted URL.
